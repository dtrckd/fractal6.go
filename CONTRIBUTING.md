- `codefactor/*`: Refactoring/Improvements of existing features.


### Git commits

The commit name should starts with a name that identify the **type** of modifications done (e.g. fix, feat, codefactor, optimization etc), then a **context** that help to determine the scope of the changes (e.g. a file name file modified or a thematic) and finally a short comment that explain, as explicitly as possible, not what modification has been done, but what behaviour has been fixed, added or removed for example.

example: `fix/schema: Add color property to roles.`
